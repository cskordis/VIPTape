# VIPTape

This project was created by Josh Bensadon that allows you to load and save code via the cassette port to and from the Cosmac VIP.

Firmware re-written to accomodate ELF II, HUG 1802/ETI-660/HEC-1802 and VIP computers.
Hardware modified in enhancing the LM358 circuit as an op amp with low pass filtering for >2500hz frequencies.

The input pin on the Mega was moved from A8 to D18 to allow correct ISR to work.
